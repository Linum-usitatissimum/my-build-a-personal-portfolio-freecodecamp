# my-build-a-personal-portfolio-freecodecamp

Welcome to the final project I completed for Responsive Web Design course with freeCodeCamp. This project I created to look fairly close to the example provided in the course. I tried to make it responsive to different device sizes. I hope I have accomplished that to some extent.

## Created with:

- html
- css

## Some things I discovered:

Doing the css is much easier when you lay things out according to need (flex-items all together, borders styled in one spot, colors laid out in one area).

Also, that I am gradually getting better at understanding flex-box. And flex-grow. And how widths, normal, max and min all work. 

## Screenshot of finished piece.

And finally, here is a screenshot of the final piece.
